# Introduction

In this project, our group developed a webshop focused on selling clothes. Our online store
allows users to shop as registered or unregistered guests, explore new arrivals, and browse
clothing items through dedicated tabs for Women and Men or all clothes at once. Within
these categories, users can filter products by specific criteria such as type of clothing,
material and color, select their preferred size and add items to their personal carts.
Our primary goal was to create a website that adheres to general design principles and
follows industry standards, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. The client
side of the application is built using React and Typescript, providing a dynamic and
responsive interface. On the server side, we implemented a RESTful API using JavaScript
and Node.js (specifically Express), which supports efficient and reliable backend operations.<img width="634" height="489" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-05 at 14 13 36" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81ca63f6-4428-4dd7-90fb-1c09bab98053" />
